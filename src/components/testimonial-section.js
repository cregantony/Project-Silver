      “Working with Creg was a great experience on several levels. First of all, he really knows technology and the
      intricacies of digital marketing. He created a plan for me that has been incredibly effective in increasing
      revenue. Second of all, he’s a great teacher, and working with him was a pleasure. As someone who has little
      experience in this world, I found his personal style to be supportive and encouraging. I continue to work with him
      as my marketing needs change.”
